# Code used during Mobwiser classes

This code will create a Calendar with the Portugal holidays highlighted.

To fetch the holidays we are using this API https://date.nager.at/Api.

Exercises:

* Add the possibility to change the country (hint: you can receive the country from the user as an input or as a dropdown)
* Highlight the current day, and make the previous ones transparent

Bonus:
* Feel free to improve CSS. As a prize we will commit it
